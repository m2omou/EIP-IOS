NEERBYY

What is it ?
------
[Neerbyy](http://neerbyy.com) is a new kind of social network, that aims to bring
a place to life.
To help us remember every single anecdote, every single story that happens here.

> Our main aim is to give life to a place, to make most of its complete history,
that people create everyday. In this way, users will be able to relive what has
happened at the location where the user is, using our application, personal
photos (a marriage proposal), official photos (investiture of a president),
a sound (the bells of a church), a video (the finish line of the Tour de France),
some text (a poem linked the place, a personal anecdote)...

>The possibilities are endless.
